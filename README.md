# Overview

As a software engineer I am wanting to branch out and work with all sorts of programs, languages, and challenges, to test my abilities and help me grow.

This project is a desktop application that runs on C++ that assists users in taking inventory of food storage. It allows the user to keep track of the names, quantity, and expiration dates of each food storage item they add to it.

My purpose in writing this software is to create a functional desktop application and demonstrate my abilities in C++.



{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
